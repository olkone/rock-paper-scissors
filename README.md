# Rock, Paper, Scissors
**Check out the [live webpage](https://olkone.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) for *Rock, Paper, Scissors*!**

## About
My take on *Rock, Paper, Scissors* was created with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## App Features
* Compete with a computer which randomly generates every play (as well as fourth-wall-breaking quips.)
* Choose rock, paper, or scissors with reactive buttons.
* View each round's results with representative icons, as well as the overall score.


## Code Features
*The following features were the main concepts I learned and implemented in this project.*

### HTML & CSS:

* Flex display
* Dynamic element transformations with transition duration on hover, click
* Element animations with keyframes changing opacity, rotation, and scale
* Custom colors, borders, sizes, margins, and padding

### JavaScript:
* Query selectors for classes and IDs
* Creating global and local variables
* Event listeners for button click
* Math.floor and Math.random methods
* Creating, accessing, and indexing arrays
* Switch statements, for-loops, if/else statements, for-each statements
* String concatenation
* DOM manipulation:
    * Update status, icon, and score inner text
    * Add and remove class lists to trigger CSS properties

## Development Tools
* VS Code
* Git/GitHub
* Chrome DevTools
* Mac Terminal
